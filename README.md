## See it in 5 seconds

This is what it looks like when you ask Demo 03 a question. You get to
watch the AI **think**, **pick a tool**, **use it**, and **answer** — step
by step, nothing hidden:

```
$ python trace.py "what is 12 times 4"
📄 Rule-based mode — a regex decides which tool to use:

[THINKING] Checking whether this needs a tool...
[TOOL CALL] calculator("12 * 4")
[TOOL RESULT] 48
[FINAL ANSWER] 12 * 4 = 48
```

> 📅 Example output, as of 23 September 2026. Every demo's README shows its
> own example output like this, so you know what to expect before you run it.

## What this is (and isn't)

This is for someone who is still trying to get a clue of what "AI" even
is. You clone the repo, run a short command, and *see* the concept happen
in plain text on your screen — no theory slides, no black box.

It is **not** a framework you build on top of, and it is **not**
production code. There is no LangChain, no CrewAI, no Docker, and no
server of ours. Every demo runs on your own computer and does one thing
clearly — in a terminal, or in your browser with its
[web version](web/), which GitHub Pages hands to your browser as plain
files.

## The demos

| # | Demo | What it shows you | Run command | Needs an API key? |
|---|------|--------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| 01 | [Tokenizer Playground](01-tokenizer-playground/) | AI doesn't read words — it reads small pieces called tokens, and guesses one at a time | `python run.py "your sentence"` | No |
| 02 | [Mini-RAG in a Terminal](02-mini-rag/) | How AI "looks things up" in documents before it answers | `python ask.py "your question"` | No (optional) |
| 03 | [Agent Trace CLI](03-agent-trace/) | What an "agent" actually does, step by step: think → use a tool → answer | `python trace.py "your task"` | No (optional) |
| 04 | [Router Playground](04-router-playground/) | How AI decides which tool/skill to use for a request | `python router.py "your request"` | No (optional) |
| 05 | [Context Window Explorer](05-context-window/) | Why AI "forgets" the start of a long chat — it only has room for so many tokens | `python explore.py` | No |
| 06 | [Hallucination Demo](06-hallucination-demo/) | Why looking things up matters — without documents, AI can only guess, and a guess can sound sure | `python compare.py "your question"` | No (optional — best with one) |
| 07 | [Prompt Engineering Playground](07-prompt-playground/) | Small wording changes to a prompt change the answer a lot — see real before/after answers, and check your own prompt | `python playground.py` | No (optional) |
| 08 | [Prompt Injection Demo](08-prompt-injection/) | A hidden instruction inside a document can hijack an AI — and a simple filter only catches the attacks it already knows | `python inject.py` | No (optional) |
| 09 | [PII Redaction Demo](09-pii-redaction/) | Black out private data (ID numbers, cards, emails) before an AI sees it — and see what simple patterns miss | `python redact.py` | No |
| 10 | [Multi-Agent Handoff](10-multi-agent-handoff/) | Two AI agents working as a team: one drafts a bug report, the other decides how urgent it is — and the handoff between them can break | `python handoff.py "describe a bug"` | No (optional — best with one) |

### 🌐 No terminal? Try it in your browser

Not a coder? **All 10 demos run right in your web browser** — nothing to
install, and they work on a phone:
**https://khadir-syed.github.io/k_ai-basics/web/**

It runs the very same Python code as the terminal version, inside your own
browser. Nothing you type is sent anywhere. Where a demo needs a real AI or
a big model, the page shows answers saved from a real run, with the date.

## Which one should I run first?

Run them **in order: 01 → 02 → 03 → 04 → 05 → 06 → 07 → 08 → 09 → 10**. Each one builds on the idea
before it:

1. **01** shows you the smallest building block — a token.
2. **02** shows AI using a pile of tokens (documents) to find an answer.
3. **03** shows AI deciding *when* to go look something up versus just
   answering — the first taste of "agent" behavior.
4. **04** pulls that decision step out on its own, scoring several
   possible skills side by side — the first taste of a full multi-agent
   system, where the hard part is picking the *right* specialist.
5. **05** goes back to 01's tokens and shows why they matter in a chat:
   the AI can only hold so many at once, so the oldest messages fall off.
6. **06** goes back to 02's "look it up first" and shows why it matters:
   the same question, answered with no documents (a guess) and with them.
7. **07** is the finishing skill: now that you know how AI works, learn to
   *ask* it well. It stands on its own, so you can also try it any time.
8. **08** is a quick look at how things go wrong: a document can carry its
   own sneaky prompt, written by an attacker instead of you.
9. **09** is the other side of the same coin: instead of bad instructions
   getting *in*, it's private data getting *out* — and how to black it out
   first.
10. **10** is the finale — this is what "multi-agent" actually means: two
    agents, each with one job, passing work between them. It builds on 03
    (one agent acting) and 04 (picking the right specialist).

Skipping ahead works fine too, but the ideas click faster in this order.

## How the pieces fit together

Think of each demo as a recipe. You can cook it in two kitchens: your
**terminal**, or your **web browser** — the browser gets a little kitchen
of its own (Python rebuilt to run inside a web page). Either way, it's the
same recipe: the demo's own `.py` file.

Most demos never talk to an AI company at all. Some *can*, but only in the
terminal, and only when **you** switch it on with `--key` and your own key.
The web pages never do.

    O -.->|"your API key"| AI[("An AI company\n(Anthropic / OpenAI)")]
```

## How to install and run a demo

1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer.
2. Open a terminal and go into the demo folder you want to try, for example:

   ```bash
   cd 01-tokenizer-playground
   ```

3. Install that demo's own small set of requirements:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run it, following that demo's own README for the exact command.

Each demo folder is self-contained — its own `requirements.txt`, its own
README, nothing shared. Copy just that one folder anywhere and it still
works.

Demos with an optional `--key` mode each carry their own copy of the same
small file, `llm.py`, which does the talking to the AI company. The copies
are kept identical, and you can check that anytime from this folder:

```bash
python3 check_llm_copies.py
```

## Where to go next

Once you've run them all and want to see what the "real," full-power
version of these ideas looks like — the actual skills, agents, and
orchestration layers this repo simplifies — **start from Demo 10**. Its two
agents passing a bug report between them are a simplified version of the
multi-agent orchestration in
[`k_ai-agent-skills`](https://github.com/khadir-syed/k_ai-agent-skills),
which adds real tool access, more agents, and human-in-the-loop checkpoints.
Demo 04's router is the other bridge: it's a simplified mirror of that
repo's `request-router-agent`, which decides which agent gets the work.
From there, head to the tech-version repos in the `k_` series. Links to all
of them: **https://khadir-syed.github.io/**
